## USER
You are supposed to design a feedback controller, Fy, such that the rise time for a step change in the reference signal is less than 0.2 s and the overshoot is less than 10%. Additionally, for a step in the disturbance, |y(t)| 1 t and |y(t)| 0.1 for t > 0.5 s, and the control signal obeys |u(t)| 1 t. To do this, you should first try to design Fy such that L(s) c/s and plot the closed-loop transfer function from d to y and the corresponding step response. Then, add a number of poles in the controller such that it becomes proper. Finally, check that all specifications are fulfilled and plot the bode diagrams of the sensitivity and complementary sensitivity functions

## ASSISTANT
To design the feedback controller Fy, let's first analyze the given information and follow the steps.

System specifications:
1. Rise time (tr) < 0.2 s
2. Percent overshoot (PO) < 10%
3. For a step in the disturbance, |y(t)| < 1 for t > 0 and |y(t)| < 0.1 for t > 0.5 s
4. Control signal obeys |u(t)| < 1 for t > 0

Let's start with designing Fy such that L(s) = c/s. This is a proportional-integral (PI) controller. The closed-loop transfer function from d to y, T(s), can be expressed as:

T(s) = P(s) * Fy(s) / (1 + P(s) * Fy(s))

Given that L(s) = P(s) * Fy(s) = c/s, we can rewrite the closed-loop transfer function as:

T(s) = (c/s) / (1 + c/s)

To find the step response of this system, we can calculate the inverse Laplace Transform of T(s). However, since the transfer function is improper (numerator degree is higher than the denominator degree), we cannot proceed with this method.

Instead, we will add poles to the controller to make it proper. Let's add a pole at s = -a (a > 0) to Fy(s):

Fy(s) = Kp + Ki/s + Kp1/(s+a)

Now the closed-loop transfer function is:

T(s) = P(s) * Fy(s) / (1 + P(s) * Fy(s))

To find the appropriate values for Kp, Ki, and Kp1, we can use trial and error or optimization techniques to meet the given specifications. Once the controller gains are chosen, we can find the step response and check the specifications.

Finally, to plot the Bode diagrams of the sensitivity (S) and complementary sensitivity (T) functions, we need to calculate S(s) and T(s):

S(s) = 1 / (1 + P(s) * Fy(s))
T(s) = P(s) * Fy(s) / (1 + P(s) * Fy(s))

Then, plot the magnitude and phase of these transfer functions in the frequency domain using a Bode plot.

In summary, the design process involves finding a suitable controller Fy(s) with added poles to meet the system specifications, analyzing the closed-loop transfer function, and plotting the Bode diagrams of the sensitivity and complementary sensitivity functions.

## ASSISTANT
To design the feedback controller Fy, we'll follow the steps as previously mentioned and use MATLAB commands to help explain the process.

Step 1: Design Fy such that L(s) = c/s
Suppose we have a plant transfer function P(s). We need to find the controller Fy(s) such that L(s) = P(s) * Fy(s) = c/s, where c is a constant.

Assuming a PI controller, Fy(s) = Kp + Ki/s. To find Kp and Ki, we can use trial and error or optimization techniques in MATLAB.

Step 2: Add poles to the controller to make it proper
Let's add a pole at s = -a (a > 0) to Fy(s):

Fy(s) = Kp + Ki/s + Kp1/(s+a)

Step 3: Check specifications and plot Bode diagrams
We'll use MATLAB commands to find the closed-loop transfer function, check specifications, and plot the Bode diagrams.

```MATLAB
% Plant transfer function P(s)
num_P = [...]; % Numerator coefficients of P(s)
den_P = [...]; % Denominator coefficients of P(s)
P = tf(num_P, den_P);

% Controller Fy(s)
Kp = ...; % Proportional gain
Ki = ...; % Integral gain
Kp1 = ...; % Additional pole gain
a = ...; % Pole location
Fy = tf([Kp Ki], [1 0]) + tf(Kp1, [1 a]);

% Closed-loop transfer function from d to y
L = series(P, Fy);
T = feedback(L, 1);

% Step response
figure;
step(T);
title('Step Response');
grid on;

% Check rise time and overshoot
stepinfo(T)

% Sensitivity and complementary sensitivity functions
S = 1 - T;
figure;
bode(S, T);
legend('Sensitivity', 'Complementary Sensitivity');
grid on;
```

Use the stepinfo() function to check if the rise time and overshoot specifications are met. Adjust the controller gains (Kp, Ki, and Kp1) and pole location (a) until the specifications are satisfied.

In summary, use MATLAB commands to design Fy(s) such that L(s) = c/s, add poles to the controller, check specifications, and plot the Bode diagrams of the sensitivity and complementary sensitivity functions. Adjust the controller gains and pole locations as needed to meet the system specifications.
